## The concept of this app is similar to Pintrest but the main focus of this app is solely on sneakers as it is aimed at sneakerheads!


#### Technologies used for this application will be the following : 
    *Node JS
    *React
    *Express
    *Mongoose
    *Html/Css/Javascript



#### For the use of this app I will be using an api called The Sneaker Database. The link to this api is : https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/tg4solutions/the-sneaker-database/1.0.0.



#### Users will be able to make an account and search for shoes based on brands and sneaker searches from the search bar and save the shoes they like on to their profile which will be stored in their profile with the shoes they like.
